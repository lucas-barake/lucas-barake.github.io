title: The Proper Way to Decode Arrays

I see this pattern way too often when working with Zod (or any schema validation library, really):

```ts
const TodoSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  title: z.string(),
  completed: z.boolean()
});

const TodosSchema = z.array(TodoSchema);
```

Seems simple enough, right? But there's a major problem that will bite you (and your users) later: if a single item in that array fails validation, **everything** fails.

Here's what I mean:

```ts
const apiResponse = [
  { id: 1, title: "Buy milk", completed: false },
  { id: "2", title: null, completed: true }, // ðŸ’¥ Malformed data
  { id: 3, title: "Clean house", completed: false }
];

// Throws error - you lose ALL todos!
TodosSchema.parse(apiResponse);
```

Even though two of those todos are perfectly valid, that one bad apple spoils the bunch. This gets especially painful when:

- You're dealing with third-party APIs that might be... let's say "inconsistent" (far too common)
- Your backend team decided to change the structure of the data without migrations (also far too common)

## A Better Approach

Instead of throwing away perfectly good data, let's build something more graceful using [Effect Schema](https://effect.website/docs/schema/introduction/). If you're not familiar with [Effect Schema](https://effect.website/docs/schema/introduction/), think of it as the next evolution in data validation. While libraries like Zod or Yup only transform `unknown` into your type `T`, Effect Schema provides bi-directional parsing - you can go from `From` to `To` and back again. Plus, its API is incredibly elegant once you get used to it.

Here's how we can create a graceful array helper:

```ts
import { Array, Schema, Either, identity, Predicate, ParseResult } from "effect";

const GracefulArrayFromFailable = <A, I, R>(schema: Schema.Schema<A, I, R>) =>
  Schema.Array(
    Schema.NullOr(schema).annotations({
      decodingFallback: (issue) => {
        const formattedIssue = ParseResult.TreeFormatter.formatIssueSync(issue);
        console.warn("[GracefulArrayFromFailable]:\n", formattedIssue);
        return Either.right(null);
      }
    })
  ).pipe(
    Schema.transform(Schema.typeSchema(Schema.Array(schema)), {
      decode: Array.filter(Predicate.isNotNull),
      encode: identity,
      strict: true
    })
  );
```

The idea is simple. We:

1. Wrap our schema in a nullable schema
2. When a value fails to parse, log a warning and return null
3. Apply a transform that filters out all null values
4. End up with a clean array of valid items

Let's see it in action:

```ts
const TodoSchema = Schema.Struct({
  id: Schema.Number,
  title: Schema.String,
  completed: Schema.Boolean
}).annotations({
  identifier: "Todo"
});

const TodosSchema = GracefulArrayFromFailable(TodoSchema);

const apiResponse = [
  { id: 1, title: "Buy milk", completed: false },
  { id: "2", title: null, completed: true }, // ðŸ’¥ Malformed data
  { id: 3, title: "Clean house", completed: false }
];

const todos = Schema.decodeUnknownSync(TodosSchema)(apiResponse);
// [GracefulArrayFromFailable]:
// Todo | null
// â”œâ”€ Todo
// â”‚  â””â”€ ["id"]
// â”‚     â””â”€ Expected number, actual "2"
// â””â”€ Expected null, actual {"id":"2","title":null,"completed":true}

console.log(todos);
// => [
//   { id: 1, title: "Buy milk", completed: false },
//   { id: 3, title: "Clean house", completed: false }
// ]
```

Clean, type-safe, and most importantly - resilient. Instead of failing completely when encountering invalid data, we gracefully handle the error while preserving all valid items.

## Composable All The Way Down

The great thing about doing it at the schema level is that you can have nested arrays and they will still be decoded gracefully:

```ts
const UserSchema = Schema.Struct({
  id: Schema.Number,
  name: Schema.String,
  todos: GracefulArrayFromFailable(TodoSchema)
}).annotations({
  identifier: "User"
});

const UsersSchema = GracefulArrayFromFailable(UserSchema);
```

If we had implemented this at the parsing level (like creating an abstraction over `Schema.decode`), we would have needed to handle each level of nesting separately, which would require a lot of boilerplate.

## Bonus: Partition Decoding

While `GracefulArrayFromFailable` is great when you just want the valid items, sometimes you need to know exactly what failed. Maybe you want to:

- Show users which items had issues and why
- Send error reports to your analytics
- Handle the invalid items differently

For these cases, we can create a partition decoder:

```ts
import { ParseResult, Schema, Either } from "effect";
import { type ParseOptions } from "effect/SchemaAST";

const decodeUnknownPartition = <A, I>(schema: Schema.Schema<A, I>, options?: ParseOptions) => {
  const decoder = Schema.decodeUnknownEither(schema, options);

  return (self: readonly unknown[]): [ParseResult.ParseError[], A[]] =>
    self.reduce<[ParseResult.ParseError[], A[]]>(
      ([excluded, satisfied], item) => {
        return Either.match(decoder(item), {
          onLeft: (error) => [Array.append(excluded, error), satisfied],
          onRight: (value) => [excluded, Array.append(satisfied, value)]
        });
      },
      [[], []]
    );
};
```

Now we can split our data into successes and failures:

```ts
const apiResponse = [
  { id: 1, title: "Buy milk", completed: false },
  { id: "2", title: null, completed: true }, // ðŸ’¥ Invalid
  { id: 3, title: "Clean house", completed: false }
];

const [errors, todos] = decodeUnknownPartition(TodoSchema)(apiResponse);

console.log(todos);
// => [
//   { id: 1, title: "Buy milk", completed: false },
//   { id: 3, title: "Clean house", completed: false }
// ]

console.log(ParseResult.TreeFormatter.formatErrorsSync(errors));
// Todo
// â””â”€ ["id"]
//    â””â”€ Expected number, actual "2"
```

And we're good to go!

I'd argue that in 90% of cases, you should be using a helper like `GracefulArrayFromFailable` instead of just `z.array()`, but of course, it depends on your use case.
